# CapstoneAPI
## Important Notes
1. As this repository is public, the code seen here has sensitive information removed (the current database host password). If you download and run this code in the current state it will not work. The updated password for the database host must be added to the ConnectionService class on line 15.
2. This API is currently being hosted, but will only remain up until Sunday, May 22, 2022. After this date, our hosting service will expire and the API will have to be local hosted in order to operate.
